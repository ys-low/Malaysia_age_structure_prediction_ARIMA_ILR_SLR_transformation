1) "Predicting population age structures of China, India, and Vietnam by 2030 based on compositional data" by Wei Y, Wang Z, Wang H, Li Y, Jiang Z (2019)
2) "The isometric logratio transformation in compositional data analysis: a practical evaluation." by Greenacre, Michael & Grunsky, Eric. (2018)

Main findings in my literature review based on section:
